# Computer Graphics

This repository is a container for the projects I developed during CS465 Computer Graphics 1. Following projects can be found in the order of development timeline:

* [Interactive Koch Curves](https://github.com/cevataykans/interactive-koch-curve): A simple WebGL project to produce fractals of koch curves.
* [Mantis Animator](https://github.com/cevataykans/mantis-animator): I greatly enjoyed developing this project. I strongly suggest you to visit the website to play around, loading/playing the default animations made by us.
* [Ray Caster](https://github.com/cevataykans/ray-caster): This was a very challenging project to develop. It taught me a lot about shading with ray casting.

All projects are hosted by _Github Pages_. Links to the project pages could be found under their respective repositories.
